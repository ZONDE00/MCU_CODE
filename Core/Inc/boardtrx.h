 * Data VS CMD
 *
 * Data can be requested from target devices, we can't send it
 * when data is requested or sent we don't care if receiving device actually got anything thus we don't get ACK or NCK
 * we only get timeout if we don't get data requested
 *
 * CMD is data like, but we send it to target device, we don't request it
 * When CMD is sent we do care if it was received or not, that is why we will wait for ACK or NCK
 * CMD uses ID system to make sure CMD is received only once, even though target device have gotten it correctly but we did not get response
 * CMD sent with same ID are dismissed, ID changes only when ACK is received from target device.
